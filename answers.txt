1. Explain why a number data type added to a string data type returns a string.

When JavaScript has to perform an operation on two different data types, it first performs type coercion to turn them into the same data type. If a string is involved, then the other operand is also turned into a string, and then the "+" operator concatenates them.
e.g. 3 + 4 === 7, but 3 + "4" === "34".

2. Name a scenario where using the "==" operator could cause a bug.

In a text-only console app, a user is choosing from the main menu.
    0: New game
    1: Continue
    2: Options
    3: Quit
New game, rad! They type 0 and press enter... and nothing happens.
See, the input from the console is a string, and the developer didn't explicitly convert the user's choice to a number using parseInt().
Originally that wasn't a problem, because they were using "==" to check the input, so it was automatically coerced to a number.
    '0' == 0  -->  true
Their instructor reviewed their code and told them to use "===" instead, so they did - but they didn't realize how that would affect their menu's functionality, so they didn't refactor anything else. And now their menu won't let anyone start a new game.
    '0' === 0  --> false
Okay this answer got a little into the weeds I guess.
